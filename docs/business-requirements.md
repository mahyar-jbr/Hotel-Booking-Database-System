# Business Requirements

## Project Overview

This database system addresses the core functionality needed for a modern hotel booking platform, focusing on scalability, data integrity, and comprehensive feature support. The system is designed to handle the complex interactions between guests, property hosts, bookings, payments, and reviews in a high-traffic environment.

## Core Objectives

The system implements:

1. **Simplified Complex Features**: Models user roles (guest vs. host), room types with associated amenities, bookings, reviews, and payment systems with proper relationships and constraints.

2. **Comprehensive Data Architecture**: Creates an Entity-Relationship model illustrating how different entities interact through well-defined relationships, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

3. **Production-Ready Implementation**: Implements the database model as a relational schema with full SQL functionalities, constraints, and optimized performance.

4. **Scalable Design**: Structures the database for high-traffic applications with proper indexing, normalization, and relationship management.
